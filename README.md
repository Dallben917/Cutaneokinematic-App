# Cutaneokinematic-App
To use this program, click on Cutaneokinematic regions affected by burns. Each selected region will turn red. At the bottom of the image, the program will display a list of cutaneokinematic selections followed by a list of prescribed stretches for 3rd degree and deep 2nd degree burns. The last list is possible functional implications from burns to these different skin regions. The functional implication list is redundant since many body parts assist with the same tasks. Additionally, the functional implications list is not exhaustive but rather general suggestions. The "Clear" button will clear all information for you to start over; there is no clear button for individual selections.
